# Generated Wyoming

This is a p5.js sketch which generates landscape images, similar to the visuals found in the game [Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/) by [Campo Santo](https://www.camposanto.com/).

Check it out on this repo's [GitHub Page](https://ajrussellaudio.github.io/wyoming/)

There is also a [bot](https://github.com/ajrussellaudio/wyoming-screengrabber) which takes posts generated images to Twitter every hour: https://twitter.com/WyWilderness
